# Hangman game

This site was created as part of my training as a web developer at Chas Academy. This corresponds to an individual assignment of my JavaScript course. The site displays a "Hangman" game. It was created using solely HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The site is responsive and adaptive to different screen sizes.

## Open the site

Download the `www` folder and open the `index.html` file. Or check the live version at this link: http://enzo.zerega.chas.academy/u03-hangman/
